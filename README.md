## Overview
The Spam Classifier project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam. The classifier achieves high accuracy through careful preprocessing, feature extraction using CountVectorizer, and rigorous model training and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam. The messages are preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information, preparing them for feature extraction and model training.

## Requirements
To run the notebook and reproduce the results, you will need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Keras
- TensorFlow

Install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn keras tensorflow

## Project Structure
- spam_classifier.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for the spam classifier project.
- data/: Directory containing the dataset (if applicable).
- models/: Directory to save and load trained models (if applicable).

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information. Preprocessing steps include:
- Removing special characters and numbers
- Converting text to lowercase
- Tokenization
- Removing stopwords

## Feature Extraction
Text data is transformed into numerical features using CountVectorizer, a bag-of-words technique. This converts the text messages into a matrix of token counts, suitable for model training.

## Model Development
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is developed using Keras and TensorFlow. The model is trained on the preprocessed and transformed data to recognize patterns indicative of spam.

## Evaluation and Optimization
The model is evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy score. Hyperparameters are fine-tuned to enhance performance, achieving an accuracy score of 98.1% on the test set.

## Usage
To use the spam classifier, run the cells in the spam_classifier.ipynb notebook. The notebook includes steps for data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Results
The spam classifier achieved an accuracy score of 98.1% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the development of a high-accuracy spam classifier using deep learning techniques. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and rigorous model evaluation in achieving optimal results.
